        <h3> What is SimTrek? </h3>
        <p>
          SimTrek is a platform that will allow users to access virtual tours
          from the comfort of one’s home. Users will have the ability to create
          a “vtravelr” account and connect with other users, potentially being
          able to take virtual tours together. Furthermore, users will be able
          to rate tours in order to enable user feedback. Virtual tours will
          contain a description of the city, pictures of the city, and a virtual
          tour that is AR accessible.
        </p>
