    <p>
      SimTrek is a platform that will allow users to access virtual tours from the comfort of one’s home. Users will have the ability to create a “vtravelr” account and connect with other users, potentially being able to take virtual tours together. Furthermore, users will be able to rate tours in order to enable user feedback. Virtual tours will contain a description of the city, pictures of the city, and a virtual tour that is AR accessible.
